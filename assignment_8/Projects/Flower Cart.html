				Complimenting this sense of curiosity with a greater understanding of its origins, a camera obscura allows for the entrance of the universe through a projection onto the floor, an opportunity to use the space as a dynamic learning environment. Bringing the wonders of the universe into the confines of a “classroom”, where students can feel their presence amongst the stars.

				Enhancing a sense of continuity, and constant awareness of being in a vessel. A single plane swoops from the entrance of the universe to its exit. The plane forms the space, acting as a floor system, an enclosure system and a structural system.

				Loosing oneself as the universe opens up above. A series of operable windows slide open to allow for the eventual exit of the universe and accentuate the vertical relationship.
