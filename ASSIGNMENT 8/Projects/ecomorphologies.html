		Located in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, between McCollough bridge and 21st street
by the Allegheny River, this large residential project aims to create environmentally
sensitive housing which reacts to both water fl ow and human circulation.

Pittburgh mapped
as an industrial
town. Overlayed
Pittsburgh maps
of and around
the site from
1870, 1890, 1910,
1940, and 2015. Th e riverfront fi rst emerged
as a convenient
industrial zone, as
the river provided
as a dump
for toxic and
waste. “Th e Strip
District” is now
a part residential
and commercial
district, close but
not connected to
the riverfront.

Pittsburgh
mapped environmentally,
signalling
number of
Combined Sewer
Overfl ows. Shows
how the area
surrounding the
site is constantly
being polluted,
another potential
reason the site
and the Strip District
is currently
not connected
with the water
front.
