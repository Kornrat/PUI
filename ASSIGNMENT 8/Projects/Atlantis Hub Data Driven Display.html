			<p class="projectText">

				type: UX / UI<br>
				year: 2018<br>

				Large environmental displays engage member of the community and must be highly readable and easily understood. These displays must organize the data into valuable meaning to the user. Skillfully using typography, composition, and color are crucial in creating an effective design that meets the needs of stakeholders and users.
				Our goal was to create a clear, efficient, and interactive data-driven environmental display to be placed in a public transportation location, Atlantis Hub. The display should take into account the needs of the users, while also allowing stakeholders to promote the PTF pass, which gives users the ability to take planes, trains, and ferries at a reduced cost.
				In the end, we took a shopper’s approach to “sell” the San Juan Islands, and the PTF, to the users through a vibrant, engaging, and intuitive data dashboard.
