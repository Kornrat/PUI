		Chinoiseries is a fashion line designed for the 2018 Lunar Gala fashion show at Carnegie Mellon University, at which over 1,200 live spectators attended and hundreds more watched on live stream.

Modern. Playful. Dignified. Harking back to centuries of tradition, Chinoiseries reintroduces traditional clothing of Asian cultures through its marriage with western references, materials and modern technology. The white and blue of Chinoiserie porcelain like delftware set the color scheme of this line, with different shades of denim representing the blue paired with white textiles of varied weights and opacities. View our line, photobook and conceptual design portfolio below.
